# Mass Spring Damper

## Overview

This is a simple ROS demonstration of a mass-spring-damper system.

![jpeg](img/system.jpeg)

The example contains two ROS 2 packages: `dynamics` and `controller`.

### System Dynamics

The system's equations of motion:

$$
        m\ddot x =  kf(t) -c\dot x -kx
$$

and after laplace transformation (with zero I.C) we get a second order system:

$$
        {X \over F} = {\omega_n^2 \over s^2 +2\omega_n\zeta s + \omega_n^2}
$$

where the natural frequency $\omega_n = \sqrt{k \over m}$

You can choose the system's parameters `m`, `k` and `c` and choose the initial condition `x0`, `v0` and `a0`, all configured as ROS 2 parameters.

### The Controller

You can write your own controller to try stabilize the system for a given setpoint.

the default controller is a simple PID controller with the following form:

$$
        f(t) = {k_pe(t) + k_i\int{e(t)dt}} + k_d {d\over dt}(e(t))
$$

you can tune the controller gains, $k_p$, $k_i$, $k_d$, configured as ROS 2 parameters.

## Prerequisites

1. Please make sure you have all the [necessary softwares](../getting_started/getting_started.md#softwares-to-work-with-citros) to work with CITROS installed on your computer.
2. Install [Visual Studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
3. We strongly recommend that you work with [dockers](..//dockerfile_overview/dockerfile_overview.md). However, if you wish to work without dockers, please refer to the [.devcontainer](https://github.com/citros-garden/mass-spring-damper/tree/main/.devcontainer) directory in project's repo, the dependencies you need are in the `Dockerfile` file.

## CITROS Initialization

1. [Install CITROS](../getting_started/getting_started.md#installation).
2. Follow [these steps](/docs_tutorials/getting_started/getting_started.md#initialization) to Initialize CITROS.

## Scenario

Supposed we tune the PID gains of the controller for the nominal mass, and we reached a satisfying results.

Now we want to know how robust was the tuning for a normal distributed mass:

$$ 
m = N(\mu, \sigma)
$$

where:

$$ 
\mu = 1.0,    
\sigma = 0.3 
$$

All the parameters can be set following the CITROS [parameter guide](https://citros.io/doc/docs_cli/structure/citros_structure#directory-parameter_setups).


The initial condition are:

$$
r_0 = -1.0[m]\\
v_0 = 0.0 [m/s]\\
a_0 = 0.0 [m/s^2]\\
$$

With $setpoint = 0.0 [m]$.

We will define the following requirements:

* Maximum overshoot of `30%`.
* Settling time is `2.0` [sec].
* Settling to `10%` of the steady-state value.

## Running the Scenario using CITROS

1. First [upload project to CITROS Server](../getting_started/getting_started.md#upload-to-citros-server)

2. Lets run `50` simulations in the server
```bash
citros run -n "default" -m "default simulation" -r -c 50
? Please choose the simulation you wish to run: 
  simulation_dynamics
❯ simulation_dynamics_controller
```
After running the command, choose the launch file you wish to run (if you'ld like to see the same [results](#results), choose `simulation_dynamics_controller`). The simulation will start and you could see the mass position and the control signal in the terminal's logs.

You can read more about the [simulation basic running option](../getting_started/getting_started.md#simulation-running-options) or [check all `run` command options](/docs_cli/commands/cli_commands#command-run)

## Results
Now we can analyze the results:

![jpeg](img/analysis.jpeg)

The full report with the data access and error analysis was generated using the data analysis package, can be found [here](https://citros.io/mass_spring_damper/blob/main/notebooks/normal_distributed_mass.ipynb)

We can see that `43` tests were passed the requirements, `6` failed and `1` was generated invalid mass $(<0)$.

The maximum mass that still meeting the requirements is equal to $1.335 [kg]$

Can you do better?
